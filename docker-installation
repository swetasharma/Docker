sudo yum searh docker
we have to create a repository for our system to pull odcker from
cd /etc/yum.repo.d/
create a docker.repo
sudo vim docker.repo
[dockerrepo]
name=Docker Repository
baseurl=https://yum.dockerproject.org/repo/main/centos/$releasever/
enabled=1
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://yum.dockerproject.org/gpg
save your system
yum update to pull in the latest updates
sudo yum update we are installing any updates we have
sudo yum install docker-engine
start docker service
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
sudo systemctl status docker to see that everything is running
docker images - what images are installed on your system
cannor connect to docker daemon
sudo docker images
cd .var/run
ls -al dock*
by defalut docker is creating a file in the var run directory its own by the docker group call docker.sock
if you are not a member of that group or you are not root by deflault you don have access to docker daemon making sure onlyauthorised members
can access to docker
implementation requires root access to run docker
we gonna add ourselves to the docker group
sudo usermod test -g docker
exit - logout
log back in
docker images
we can now connect successfully to docker daemon
docker run hello-world
docker version
docker info

var/lib/docker is where all of our images and contaniners goinf to live
df -h
sudo su -
cd /var/lib/docker
ll
cd containers
ll
cd 121548787874 - directory that has information about containers
docker ps - currently running containers
docker ps -a - see containers we have run
 cd ..
cd ..
cd image/

cd sha256/ ll
docker images


Lets pull an image:
https://hub.docker.com/
whoami
docker pull ubuntu:xenial
docker images
docker run -i -t ubuntu:xenial /bin/bash - this will attach you immediately to the container. it will attach as root user to the container
ps aux
docker restart container ip/ container id or container name
you simply restarted the conatiner yo have not loggin to that container
docker ps
docker inspect ubuntu:xenial - if you want to get more information about this container
docker attach containerName - you will be back to your container
